# System Design Interview Preparation — Senior SWE Roadmap

A condensed study path through the [main repo](README.md) for **Senior SWE** (Google L5 / Senior Engineer) system design interview prep.

---

## Target & Goal

**Target:** Google L5 / Senior Engineer system design interviews.

**Goal:** Ship a clear, scalable design in 45 minutes — requirements, capacity estimate, main components, and key trade-offs.

---

## Section 1 — Mindset (skim)

Skim for interview presence: designing under ambiguity and leading the conversation.

| Chapter | Link |
|---------|------|
| 4 | [Chapter 4](Section1/Chapter_4.md) |
| 6 | [Chapter 6](Section1/Chapter_6.md) |

*Optional:* Ch 1–3, 5 for full mindset context.

## Section 2 — System Design Framework

| Chapter | Link |
|---------|------|
| 7 | [Chapter 7](Section2/Chapter_7.md) |
| 8 | [Chapter 8](Section2/Chapter_8.md) |
| 9 | [Chapter 9](Section2/Chapter_9.md) |
| 10 | [Chapter 10](Section2/Chapter_10.md) |
| 11 | [Chapter 11](Section2/Chapter_11.md) |
| 12 | [Chapter 12](Section2/Chapter_12.md) |
| 13 | [Chapter 13](Section2/Chapter_13.md) |

## Section 3 — Distributed Systems (core)

| Chapter | Link |
|---------|------|
| 14 | [Chapter 14](Section3/Chapter_14.md) |
| 15 | [Chapter 15](Section3/Chapter_15.md) |
| 17 | [Chapter 17](Section3/Chapter_17.md) |
| 18 | [Chapter 18](Section3/Chapter_18.md) |
| 19 | [Chapter 19](Section3/Chapter_19.md) |

*Optional for depth:* Ch 16, 20.

---

## Section 4 — Data Systems (required reference)

Use when practicing problems that need DB, cache, or async flows. Don’t skip — L5 interviews expect you to justify storage and caching choices.

| Chapter | Link |
|---------|------|
| 21 | [Chapter 21](Section4/Chapter_21.md) |
| 22 | [Chapter 22](Section4/Chapter_22.md) |
| 23 | [Chapter 23](Section4/Chapter_23.md) |

---

## Section 5 — Senior-Level Design Problems

Practice end-to-end with these 13 problems. Each has a full walkthrough: requirements, scale, architecture, failure handling.

**Priority:** Do **6–8 problems in depth** (timed, out loud, with diagrams). Quality beats covering all 13. Start with the must-practice set.

### Must practice (high frequency at L5)

| Chapter | Link |
|---------|------|
| 29 | [Chapter 29](Section5/Chapter_29.md) |
| 39 | [Chapter 39](Section5/Chapter_39.md) |
| 28 | [Chapter 28](Section5/Chapter_28.md) |
| 30 | [Chapter 30](Section5/Chapter_30.md) |
| 32 | [Chapter 32](Section5/Chapter_32.md) |
| 31 | [Chapter 31](Section5/Chapter_31.md) |

### Second tier

| Chapter | Link |
|---------|------|
| 33 | [Chapter 33](Section5/Chapter_33.md) |
| 34 | [Chapter 34](Section5/Chapter_34.md) |
| 38 | [Chapter 38](Section5/Chapter_38.md) |
| 36 | [Chapter 36](Section5/Chapter_36.md) |
| 35 | [Chapter 35](Section5/Chapter_35.md) |
| 37 | [Chapter 37](Section5/Chapter_37.md) |
| 40 | [Chapter 40](Section5/Chapter_40.md) |

---

## Practice strategy

- **Timebox:** 45 minutes end-to-end. Roughly: clarify & requirements (5–8 min), scale/capacity (5 min), high-level design (15–20 min), deep dive 1–2 components (10–15 min), trade-offs & wrap-up (5 min).
- **Practice out loud:** Talk through reasoning, state assumptions, draw the diagram as you go.
- **Use the framework:** Follow the 5-phase flow (Section 2) every time.
- **Reference as needed:** When a problem needs DB choice, caching, or events, open the relevant Section 4 chapter and Section 3 (e.g. sharding, consistency).
